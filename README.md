# lasertag-esp8266
The idea:
Create a lasertag system based around the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) microcontroller. Give the system the possibility to work offline and online. Basically the offline option is to start up the system with a set amount of life and "munition".
The online option is going to be the extended option you can run a server on which the system will login and send/receive data. This so you can setup different teams and add player names. Also to monitor the scores and to be able to give a player more ammo or lives.

I am writing all code in the arduino development environment and am still learning to program. The project is going to be ambitious but I don't think it is going to be impossible.

I am using following libraries:
IRremoteESP8266 https://github.com/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266 under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
ESP8266 https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
arduinoWebSockets library by Links2004 https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets


I also used documentation from https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap01%20-%20ESP8266.html
