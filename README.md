# lasertag-esp8266
The idea:
Create a lasertag system based around the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) microcontroller. Give the system the possibility to work offline and online. Basically the offline option is to start up the system with a set amount of life and "munition".
The online option is going to be the extended option you can run a server on which the system will login and send/receive data. This so you can setup different teams and add player names. Also to monitor the scores and to be able to give a player more ammo or lives.

I am writing all code in the arduino development environment and am still learning to program. The project is going to be ambitious but I don't think it is going to be impossible.
